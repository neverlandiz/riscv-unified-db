description: |
  This optional register is only accessible in S/HS-mode, VS-mode, M-mode and Debug Mode.
  Accessibility of this CSR is controlled by mstateenzero[57] and hstateenzero[57] in the 
  Smstateen extension. Enabling scontext can be a security risk in a virtualized system 
  with a hypervisor that does not swap scontext. 
  
  This CSR is read/write.
