  This optional register is only accessible in S/HS-mode, VS-mode, M-mode and Debug Mode.
  Accessibility of this CSR is controlled by mstateen0[57] and hstateen0[57] in the 
  Smstateen extension. Enabling scontext can be a security risk in a virtualized system 
  with a hypervisor that does not swap scontext. 
  
  This CSR is read/write.

      Supervisor mode software can write a context number to
      this register, which can be used to set triggers that only fire
      in that specific context.
      An implementation may tie any number of high bits in
      this field to 0. Itâ€™s recommended to implement 16 bits on
      RV32 and 32 bits on RV64.
