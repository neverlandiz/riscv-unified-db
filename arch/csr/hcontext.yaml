  This optional register may be implemented only if the H extension is implemented. 
  If it is implemented, mcontext must also be implemented. 
  
  This register is only accessible in HS-Mode, M-mode and Debug Mode. If Smstateen is implemented, 
  then accessibility of in HS-Mode is controlled by mstateenzero[57].

  This register is an alias of the mcontext register, providing access to the hcontext field from HS-Mode.
