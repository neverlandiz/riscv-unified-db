  For each hstateen CSR, bit 63 is defined to control access to the matching sstateen CSR.
  Bit 63 of hstateen1 controls access to sstateen1.

  With the hypervisor extension, the hstateen CSRs have identical encodings to the mstateen
  CSRs, except controlling accesses for a virtual machine (from VS and VU modes).

  For every bit in an hstateen CSR that is zero (whether read-only zero or set to zero),
  the same bit appears as read-only zero in sstateen when accessed in VS-mode.

  A bit in an hstateen CSR cannot be read-only one unless the same bit is read-only one
  in the matching mstateen CSR.
