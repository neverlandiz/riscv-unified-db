  For RV64 harts, the Smstateen extension adds four new 64-bit CSRs at machine level: `mstateen0` (Machine State
  Enable 0), `mstateen1`, `mstateen2`, and `mstateen3`. For RV32, the registers listed above are 32-bit, and for the
  machine-level CSRs there is a corresponding set of high-half CSRs for the upper 32 bits of each register:
  `mstateen0h`, `mstateen1h`, `mstateen2h`, `mstateen3h`.
