  For each `hstateen` CSR, bit 63 is defined to control access to the matching `sstateen` CSR.
  Bit 63 of `hstateen3` controls access to `sstateen3`.

  With the hypervisor extension, the `hstateen` CSRs have identical encodings to the `mstateen`
  CSRs, except controlling accesses for a virtual machine (from VS and VU modes).

  For every bit in an `hstateen` CSR that is zero (whether read-only zero or set to zero),
  the same bit appears as read-only zero in `sstateen` when accessed in VS-mode.

  A bit in an `hstateen` CSR cannot be read-only one unless the same bit is read-only one
  in the matching `mstateen` CSR.
