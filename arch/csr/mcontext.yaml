  This register must be implemented if hcontext is implemented, and is optional otherwise. 
  It is only accessible in M-mode and Debug mode.

  hcontext is primarily useful to set triggers on hypervisor systems that only fire when a 
  given VM is executing. It is also useful in systems where M-Mode implements something like 
  a hypervisor directly.

  This CSR is read/write.

      M-Mode or HS-Mode (using hcontext) software can write a
      context number to this register, which can be used to set
      triggers that only fire in that specific context.
      An implementation may tie any number of upper bits in
      this field to 0. If the H extension is not implemented, it’s
      recommended to implement 6 bits on RV32 and 13 bits on
      RV64 (as visible through the mcontext register). If the H
      extension is implemented, it’s recommended to
      implement 7 bits on RV32 and 14 bits on RV64.
