description: |
  The accrued exception flags indicate the exception conditions that have arisen on any floating-point
  arithmetic instruction since the field was last reset by software. The base RISC-V ISA does not
  support generating a trap on the setting of a floating-point exception flag.

  As allowed by the standard, we do not support traps on floating-point exceptions in the F
  extension, but instead require explicit checks of the flags in software. We considered
  adding branches controlled directly by the contents of the floating-point accrued exception
  flags, but ultimately chose to omit these instructions to keep the ISA simple.

      *Invalid Operation*

      Cumulative error flag for floating point operations.

      Set by hardware when a floating point operation is invalid and stays set until explicitly
      cleared by software.
    type: RW-H
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  DZ:
    location: 3
    description: |
      *Divide by zero*

      Cumulative error flag for floating point operations.

      Set by hardware when a floating point divide attempts to divide by zero and stays set until explicitly
      cleared by software.
    type: RW-H
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL

    description: |
      *Overflow*

      Cumulative error flag for floating point operations.

      Set by hardware when a floating point operation overflows and stays set until explicitly
      cleared by software.
    type: RW-H
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  UF:
    location: 1
    description: |
      *Underflow*

      Cumulative error flag for floating point operations.

      Set by hardware when a floating point operation underflows and stays set until explicitly
      cleared by software.
    type: RW-H
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  NX:
    location: 0
    description: |
      *Inexact*

      Cumulative error flag for floating point operations.

      Set by hardware when a floating point operation is inexact and stays set until explicitly
      cleared by software.
    type: RW-H
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
