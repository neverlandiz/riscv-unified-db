  For RV64 harts, the Smstateen extension adds four new 64-bit CSRs at machine level: mstateen0 (Machine State
  Enable 0), mstateen1, mstateen2, and mstateen3. For RV32, the registers listed above are 32-bit, and for the
  machine-level CSRs there is a corresponding set of high-half CSRs for the upper 32 bits of each register:
  mstateen0h, mstateen1h, mstateen2h, mstateen3h.
